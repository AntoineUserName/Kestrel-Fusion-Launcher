# Installation

1. You need to extract the game files (I can't explain here how to make it sorry).

2. To download the app : [https://github.com/AntoineUserName/Kestrel-Fusion-Launcher/releases/latest/download/kestrel-fusion-launcher-win32-x64.zip](https://github.com/AntoineUserName/Kestrel-Fusion-Launcher/releases/latest/download/kestrel-fusion-launcher-win32-x64.zip)

3. Its a zip file, put it in a folder, then right click on this file -> extract (or use another software if it's not here by default in your os)

4. Go to the new folder created and now you must see files with a .exe, open the file named "game-location.txt"

5. Replace all the text in this file by your game path, this is the path where you have the exe game file and the extracted files

6. Save and open the .exe file, if you have windows warning click on "more info" and "run anyway"

# Using a mod

Open the app and active the mod by the checkbox of the mod profile.

# Adding a mod

1. Open the app, scroll down and click on the button named "Import mod".

2. Select the mod folder (he must contain a mod.json file).

3. Click on open.

4. If you have an error message, check if you have selected the folder with the mod.json file.

# How the launcher edit files ?

Each time the launcher edits a file it saves a backup of the file at "GAMEPATH/KF-Files/backup-files" and if you use the beta version the backup folder is at "LAUNCHERPATH/resources/app/backup-files".
