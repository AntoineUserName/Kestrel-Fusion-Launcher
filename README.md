# Installation

1. You need to extract the game files (I can't explain here how to make it sorry).

2. Check that in the "game-location.txt" file the text is the path of the folder that contains the game files and the .exe file.

# Using a mod

Open the app and active the mod by the checkbox of the mod profile.

# Adding a mod

1. Open the app, scroll down and click on the button named "Import mod".

2. Select the mod folder (he must contain a mod.json file).

3. Click on open.

4. If you have an error message, check if you have selected the folder with the mod.json file.
